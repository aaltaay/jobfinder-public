# {{AGENT_TITLE}} memory (living)

Living knowledge for the Job Finder `{{AGENT_ID}}` subagent. **Read at the start of every run. Update at the end when something new was learned.**

Companion to: `.cursor/agents/{{AGENT_ID}}.md`

## Current snapshot

## How to continue improving

> {{PRIMARY_INVOKE}}

Or:
